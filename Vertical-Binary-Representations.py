"""
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the binary representations of the integers from N to 1 vertically as shown in the Example Input/Output 
section. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= N <= 10^5 

Input Format: 
The first line contains N. 

Output Format: 
The lines, contain the binary representations of the integers from N to 1 vertically.

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 
8 

Output: 
11111111 
0110010 
01010
0 

Explanation: 
The binary representation of the integers from 1 to 8 are given below. 
1 -> 1 
2 -> 10 
3 -> 11 
4 -> 100 
5 -> 101 
6 -> 110 
7 -> 111 
8 -> 1000 
The binary representations of the integers from 8 to 1 are printed vertically. 

Example Input/Output 2:
Input: 
17 

Output:
11111111111111111
0011110000110010 
00110011001010
